Quicksort-CPP
=============

This small C++ project implements an in-place version of Quicksort.

To use the code you should include quicksort.cpp and call QuickSort::quickSort(...). The quicksort function takes 3 parameters, a vector of the items to be sorted, the index of the leftmost item to be sorted (usually 0), and the index of the rightmost item to be sorted (usually the index of the last item, or the size of the array - 1).

You can also look at quicksortTest.h for an example of how to use the Quicksort code.
